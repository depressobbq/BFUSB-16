# BFUSB-16
its a Big effin USB hub, based on off the shelf parts.

The goal here is to have something with easy to source parts, that asre simultaniously as easy to solder by hand as possible. I went with good ol barrel caps, and single stacked usbs. Also I went with crystals at each of the hub chips, despite them being able to run without one, just due to no trusting it to actually do so. the hope here being that with nice big beefy caps and crystals on each hub chip, this thing ought to be stable even fully populated.
If it works as intended, it should be great for people like me who need a million USB's hooked to their PC for sim racing, but it would also be cool to see if it would work as a 16 USB RAID0 (if my numbers are correct your average flashdrive * 16 is the full usb 2 bandwidth)
ANy comments / questions, leave them in the issues, and if you want to help improve the design make a pull request. Im usually not far from a keyboard. This PCB should be good to go with either JLCPCB ( my favorite) or PCBWay.
